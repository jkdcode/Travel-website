            <h3>About this website</h3>
            <p>
              I created this website to practice my coding skills as a SheCodes
              student. The prompt was to build a travel website, and there was
              nothing to stop me from creating a travel website for a fictional
              destination! Baldur's Gate is a staple city within the Dungeons &
              Dragons universe, and maybe you've even gone there in a video game
              or three!
