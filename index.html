            <h3>About this website</h3>
            <p>
              I created this website to practice my coding skills as a SheCodes
              student. The prompt was to build a travel website, and there was
              nothing explicitly stopping me from creating a travel website for
              a fictional destination, so here we are. Baldur's Gate is a staple
              city within the Dungeons & Dragons universe, and maybe you've even
              gone there in a video game or three!
